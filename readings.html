<h2>Reading Discussion I: Tool Standards and Poetics</h2>
</div>

<br>

<div id="textchunk1">
   <p>The two readings were from<a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/06/github-microsoft-open-source-code-technology">Jacobin Magazine</a> and the<a href="https://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/the-programmed-designer">Eye Magazine</a>. The two questions we answered regarding the articles were:
   </p>
   <p> "1. The two articles both articulate an ethical problem related to their topic (industry-standard design tools & the current scale and state of open-source tech). Define what you consider to be the authors positions in relation to these two topics and how they overlap. What connections can you draw between these two articles? Do they prescribe solutions that are pertinent to each other?" </p>
       
   <p>"2. Aside from the mastery of certain digital tools and programs, what skills do you see as integral to your graphic design practice?"</p>
</div>

<div id="textchunk2">
    <p>Here is my response to these readings:</p>
    <p>1. For the article by Eye Magazine, I believe the stance of the author is that Apple and Adobe have too much hold over the practice of design and designers should consider a more independent design practice. I think the author is promoting using open-source software and generally re-considering how we use our "tools". I think this particular sentence from the article summarizes the authors position: "Uniform dependence on these products commodifies the activity of design itself." The other article, from Jacobin, is focused on coding and the author's position is very pro-open source code and they believe a democratically organized tech centre would be good for the future of coding. Both articles are focused on ways to stray from capitalism and over-powered corporations as well as moving towards sharing skills and ideas with open source software and code. I think the solutions suggested in both articles are similar, but I think the Eye Magazine one is more about being independent while the Jacobin Magazine one suggests more of a group effort. However, the ideas of supporting open source and not sticking with the forced industry-standard are present in both articles and are pertinent to each-other. </p>

    <p> 2. I think typography and type-setting is really important. That's a bit obvious but I think being able to do it by hand as well and not relying on a single digital tool is important. Learning about it as a practice and being able to apply it in many different ways in design is important. Also, for me, I think illustration skills are integral to my personal design practice. Being able to use those skills with design is important to my practice and I think it offers different perspectives and opportunities with graphic design.</p>

    <h2>Reading Discussion II: Olia Lialina — Turing Complete User & Laurel Schwulst — My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge...
    </h2>
</div>

<div id="textchunk4">
    <p>For this discussion, the two readings were Olia Lialina's<a href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/turing-complete-user/">Turing Complete User</a> and Laurel Schwulst's<a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/">My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge...</a> </p>
<p>The two questions we were responding to were:</p>
<p>"1. What do you think of Lialina's definition of the universal user? Do you think it is a useful category for understanding Schwulst’s argument advocating for individual websites over platforms? Explain why and provide at least 1 example. </p>
<p>"2. What kind of computer user are you? Draw on concepts from Lialina’s text, and integrate a quotation in your answer. Make use of metaphor, if you can, to describe your experience online (à la Schwulst)."</p>
</div>

<div id="textchunk5">
    <p>Here was my response:</p>
    <p>1. I think it is an interesting idea and a useful category for understanding Schwulst's argument. Both are talking about independence as a user of the web and I think that Lialina's discussion of how Univeral Users make their own way of doing things really ties in with Schwulst saying websites can be what we want them to be. "Sometimes it is a conscious choice not to delegate particular jobs to the computer, and sometimes it is just a habit." I think this quote in particular really goes well with what Schwulst says here: "...the internet is made up of individual nodes: individual computers talking to other individual computers." Lialina's comment on how Univeral Users are all of us to some degree as there is always individuality in computer users makes Schwulst's argument make more sense: it is human nature to want to create our own space on the internet as opposed to being stuck using a platform where everything is decided for us.</p>

    <p>2. I think I might be an Invisible User. I don't usually question the decisions my computer makes for me and I usually like shortcuts. But the ideas about designers being encouraged to be excited about not having to do the "grunt work" and only having to do the "creative" work ("The less you think about source code, scripts, links and the web itself, the more creative you are as a web designer") really resonated with me because I find coding really interesting and I think this part of Lialina's text reminded me what I like about design, which is being able to do all of it. I still think it sometimes is nice to be able to accomplish things quickly with Adobe shortcuts but this text reminded me that doing all the work and having control over every part of something is also something great in design.</p>
